# MIZZAP - Claude Progress Update Prompt

**Use this prompt when working with Claude in Windsurf**

Copy this and paste it to Claude whenever you finish a task or at end of day:

---

```
Before we finish today, please update PROGRESS.md with:

1. Mark any COMPLETED tasks as ‚úÖ with commit links
2. Update progress percentage for current week
3. Add time spent on each task
4. Note any blockers or questions that came up
5. Briefly describe what was built

Format:
- Status: ‚úÖ Done (or üü° In Progress, or üöß Blocked)
- Commit link: https://github.com/stephane46/mizzap/commit/XXXXX
- What was built: [1-2 line description]
- Time: X hours
- Next: [what comes next]

If there are blockers or questions, add them to the Blockers section so St√©phane can review.
```

---

## How to Use This

**At the end of each work session**:

Ask Claude in Windsurf:
```
Update PROGRESS.md with today's work. We:
1. Built [feature]
2. Time spent: X hours
3. Commits: [list commits]
4. Any blockers? [describe]
```

Claude updates the file and commits it to GitHub.

## Every Friday

Ask Claude:
```
Generate a weekly status report in PROGRESS.md following the "Template for Weekly Status" section.
Include all this week's tasks, blockers, and questions for St√©phane.
```

---

## Every 2 Weeks (Check-in with St√©phane)

Go back to St√©phane and share:
1. PROGRESS.md file (show him the table)
2. Any blockers that need his decision
3. Any questions about architecture

St√©phane reviews and provides guidance for next 2 weeks.
