# MIZZAP - Development Progress Tracking

**Purpose**: Track where we are in development, what's been built, what's next.

**Updated by**: Claude + You during development

## How This Works

**Every time Claude helps you with a task, update this file**:

1. ✅ Mark task as DONE
2. 📝 Add brief description of what was built
3. 📊 Update progress percentage
4. 🔗 Link to GitHub commit
5. ❓ Note any blockers or questions

**Every Friday**: Review this file to see week's progress

**Every month**: Check back with me (Stéphane) with this summary for guidance

## How to Update This File

### When Starting a Task (Claude says)

```markdown
Starting: User registration endpoint

**What**: Building POST /api/v1/auth/register
**Why**: Required for Phase 1 MVP - users need to create accounts
**How**: Express endpoint + Zod validation + bcrypt hashing
**Timeline**: 2-3 hours
**Files**: backend/src/controllers/auth.ts, backend/src/services/auth.ts
```

### When Task is DONE (Claude says)

```markdown
✅ COMPLETED: User registration endpoint

**What was built**: 
- POST /api/v1/auth/register with email validation
- Password hashing (bcrypt, 12 salt rounds)
- User created in PostgreSQL
- Returns JWT token

**Commit**: https://github.com/stephane46/mizzap/commit/abc123
**Test coverage**: 94%
**Security checks**: 
  ✅ No SQL injection (Drizzle ORM parameterized)
  ✅ No plaintext passwords (bcrypt hashed)
  ✅ Input validation (Zod)
  ✅ Rate limiting ready

**Time spent**: 2.5 hours
**Next task**: User login endpoint
```

### When Blockers Occur (Claude says)

```markdown
🚧 BLOCKER: Redis connection failing

**Issue**: Cannot connect to Redis on port 6379
**Error**: ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:6379
**Attempted**: Restarted Redis, checked firewall
**Need help**: Should we use managed Redis (AWS ElastiCache) or self-hosted?
**Decision needed**: By Friday so we can proceed with job queue

Tagging: @Stéphane for guidance
```

### When Questions Arise (You or Claude)

```markdown
❓ QUESTION: CLIP model hosting - on-device or server-side?

**Context**: Building deduplication engine (Month 3)
**Options**: 
  A) TensorFlow Lite on mobile (privacy, larger app size)
  B) Server-side inference (smaller app, privacy concerns)
  C) Hybrid (simple hashing mobile, complex CLIP server-side)

**Recommendation**: Option C (hybrid)
**Decision needed**: By Week 1 of Month 3 to start implementation

Tagging: @Stéphane for final decision
```
