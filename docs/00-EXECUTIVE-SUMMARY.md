## üéØ Vision

MIZZAP helps modern families bring order, emotion, and meaning back to their photo and video memories. We own the space between storage and storytelling‚Äîproviding privacy-first deduplication, intelligent curation, and a direct path to professional film creation (MEMOPYK) and photo retouching (photALL).

**Guiding Principle**: "We don't just store memories ‚Äî we help people feel them again."

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Duplicate detection accuracy | UX blocker if incorrect | Extensive QA + user control (confirmation before delete) |
| Performance at scale (1M+ photos) | Churn if slow | Local processing + batch jobs + caching |
| Privacy/GDPR compliance | Legal + reputation | Privacy-first design, EU-only data, explicit consent |
| Market competition (Google, Apple) | Low differentiation | Focus on privacy + dedup + curation (not just storage) |
| AI model quality | Poor curation = low upsell | Start with curated models, iterate on feedback |
