## 🚀 Now Do This (Today)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository (5 minutes)

```bash
# Go to GitHub
# https://github.com/new

# Create repository:
# Name: mizzap
# Description: Privacy-first photo & video organization platform
# Public: YES
# Initialize: No README (we have one)
# Click: Create repository
```

### Step 2: Initialize Local Git Repo (10 minutes)

```bash
# Open PowerShell in this folder:
cd "C:\Users\ngocn\OneDrive\1 Personal\1 NOUS\MEMOPYK EURL\Systems"

# Create mizzap folder
mkdir mizzap
cd mizzap

# Initialize git
git init
git config user.email "stephane.eloit@outlook.com"
git config user.name "Stephane Eloit"

# Create backend/frontend structure
mkdir backend frontend docs

# Copy architecture docs
copy "..\photo-memory-app-architecture\*" "docs\"

# Create README
echo "# MIZZAP - Privacy-First Photo & Video Organization Platform" > README.md

# Create .gitignore
cat > .gitignore << 'EOF'
# Node
node_modules/
npm-debug.log

git commit -m "Initial project structure and documentation"

# Add remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/stephane46/mizzap.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Open in Windsurf (5 minutes)

1. **Launch Windsurf**
2. **File → Open Folder**
3. **Select**: `C:\Users\ngocn\OneDrive\1 Personal\1 NOUS\MEMOPYK EURL\Systems\mizzap`
4. Windsurf opens your project

### Step 4: Start with Claude (1 minute)

1. **Press Ctrl+Shift+L** (opens Claude chat)
2. **Paste this**:

```
Hi Claude! I'm starting MIZZAP, a privacy-first photo organization platform. 
I have complete architecture docs in the `/docs` folder. I'm ready to build the 
backend starting with authentication service (Month 1, Week 1-2). 

Can you:
1. Acknowledge you understand the project
2. Tell me the first 3 things I should create
3. Suggest Week 1 tasks

I'll use the Master System Prompt provided in docs/03-WINDSURF-SETUP-GUIDE.md
```

3. Claude responds with immediate guidance

## 📅 Week 1 Tasks (What to Do This Week)

### Task 1: Backend Project Setup (Tuesday)
- [ ] `npm init` in backend folder
- [ ] Install Express, TypeScript, etc.
- [ ] Create folder structure (src/services, src/controllers, etc.)
- [ ] Set up tsconfig.json
- [ ] Create .eslintrc + prettier config

### Task 2: Database & Supabase (Wednesday-Thursday)
- [ ] Create Supabase project (France region)
- [ ] Create database schema (see architecture doc)
- [ ] Test database connection
- [ ] Create migrations folder

### Task 3: Auth Service (Thursday-Friday)
- [ ] Create `backend/src/services/auth.ts`
- [ ] Implement password hashing (bcrypt)
- [ ] Ask Claude to generate it (Ctrl+Shift+L)
- [ ] Write tests
- [ ] Commit to GitHub

## 🎯 Remember

✅ **Use the Master Prompt** from `03-WINDSURF-SETUP-GUIDE.md`
- Copy it into Windsurf when you want Claude to understand full context
- Or just ask Claude - it's already intelligent!

✅ **Commit often**
- Commit hourly, even if incomplete
- Easy to revert if needed

✅ **Ask Claude everything**
- Ctrl+Shift+L at any time
- "Review this code for security"
- "Generate an API endpoint for..."
- "Explain why this architecture choice"

✅ **Check the Quick Reference**
- `04-QUICK-REFERENCE.md` is your daily lookup
- Tech stack, commands, debugging tips

❌ **Don't overthink**
- You have solid architecture
- Just implement step-by-step
- Claude helps at every step

## 📞 If You Get Stuck

**Problem**: "I don't know where to start"  
**Solution**: Press Ctrl+Shift+L, paste:
```
Based on the MIZZAP architecture docs, what's the very first thing I should 
code to get the backend running (no database, just a simple server)?
```

**Problem**: "This isn't working"  
**Solution**: Show Claude the error:
```
Getting this error: [paste error]
Here's my code: [paste relevant code]
Help me debug this.
```

**Problem**: "Is my approach right?"  
**Solution**: Ask before coding:
```
I want to implement [feature]. Should I [approach A] or [approach B]? 
Which is better for a privacy-first app?
```
